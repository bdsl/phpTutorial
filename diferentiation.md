# Differentiating this from other resources

To motivate work on writing this tutorial, it should ideally offer something different to (but not necessarily better
than) all preexisting resources.

Various resources were suggested in comments at 
https://www.reddit.com/r/PHP/comments/f5ix6n/anyone_know_a_good_php_as_a_second_language/ :

## PHP The Right Way

See [intro](content/01-introduction.md).

## Laracasts - The PHP Practitioner

Looks like it covers a lot of the same stuff I want to cover, but with different approach. Most obviously this will
be a text based tutorial for readers to use at their own pace, not a series of videos. Laracasts covers mixing HTML
with PHP which I plan to skip. Doesn't use strict types in code examples. Final section is about Laravel, which I
disprefer. I don't plan to include anything on how to use a framework but will include something about them in a
'what next' section at the end, perhaps including links to https://symfony.com/doc/current/setup.html 
and https://symfony.com/doc/current/create_framework/index.html

Although the course is free the Laracasts website has lots of paid content, and the site overall feels quite focused
on selling subscriptions.

# Derek Banas on YouTube

Video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TF00hJI78Y

Video is old - from 2014. Again mixes PHP and HTML. 

# Learn X in Y minutes 

https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/php/

Again this is not focused on contemporary PHP - it "describes PHP 5+". I want to describe PHP 7.2+, if I don't decide
to just do 7.4 only. I do like the terse format - very quick to read through, but this is aiming to a be a bit gentler.

# Official Documentation

See [intro](content/01-introduction.md) again. Tutorial part is much too minimal, docs as a whole go into much more
detail than desired here.
