# Basic PHP tutorial

(c) Barney Laurance 2020

I'm planning to write an introductory PHP tutorial here, as there doesn't seem to be anything I'm really happy
recommending already free online.

The actual content of the tutorial is in the [content](./content) directory. It is now being automatically turned
into a static HTML website by CircleCI running the [generate.php](./generate.php) script. To view the version for
any recent commit, click the green tick by the commit, click the 'Details' link next to 'ci/circleci', and then click
"Display link to build website". You should see a URL to paste into the address bar.
