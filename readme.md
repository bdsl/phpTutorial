# Basic PHP tutorial

(c) Barney Laurance 2020

I'm planning to write an introductory PHP tutorial here, as there doesn't seem to be anything I'm really happy
recommending already free online.

The actual content of the tutorial is in the [content](./content) directory. Eventually it should be used to build
a website.
